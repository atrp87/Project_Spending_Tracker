### Spending Tracker :dollar:

I had one week to build build a web application that allows a user to track their spending.
During this project I got to consolidate and expand on everything I had learned in the previous 3 weeks @ CodeClan.

* Ruby
* PostgreSQL
* Sinatra

* Restful routes
* CRUD Action
* Single responsibility
* project structure and good naming conventions.

Breif:

* The app should allow the user to create and edit merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
* The app should allow the user to create and edit tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
* The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.

Project Overview:

* Planning
* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Web Programming (Sinatra, REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)
* Version control Git & GitHub
* Presentation
