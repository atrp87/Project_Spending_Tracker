### Spending Tracker

I had one week to build build a web application to consolidate and expand on everything I had learned in the previous 3 weeks @ CodeClan.

During this project I got to consolidate Restful routes, single responsibility, project structure and good naming conventions.

* Planning
* Presentation
* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Web Programming (Sinatra, REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)
* Version control Git & GitHub
