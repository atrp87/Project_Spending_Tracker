## Spending Tracker :dollar:

I had one week to build build a Web application where the user can manage expenses to individual categories, then assign expenditure to one of those categories and display all transactions.

During this project I got to consolidate and expand on everything I had learned in the previous 3 weeks @ CodeClan.

* OOP - Ruby
* TDD - MiniTest
* Web Programming - Sinatra (REST, MVC)
* DB design - PostgreSQL
* HTML & CSS
* Version control - Git & GitHub
* Agile methodologies

### Project Overview:

* The app should allow the user to create and edit merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
* The app should allow the user to create and edit tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
* The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.
